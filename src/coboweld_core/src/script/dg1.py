*  Author: Victor W H Wu
*  Date: 27 October 2022.
*
*  Revision 1: 14 November, 2022.
*     To import Open3d ros helper for open3d and ros point cloud conversions.
*     The original conversion does not work anymore in ROS Noetic. Details of this
*     package, refer to README.md.
*
*  Revision 2: 16 November, 2022.
*     The function select_down_sample was replaced by select_by_index in Open3d
*     This script tries to detect groove in the workpiece.
*
*  Revision 3: 3 February, 2023.
*     Moved the code from cncweld_core to CoboWeld.
*
*  Revision 4: 9 February, 2023.
*     Introduce URx into CoboWeld.

*
*  Description:
*    This script is based on Jeffery Zhou's work.
*    It uses Open3D to handle point clouds and visions, ROS and RViz to visualize
*    the operations. URx is used to actually move the UR5 manipulator.
*
*  It requires:
*  rospy, 
*  numpy, 
*  open3d, 
*  math,
*  open3d_ros_helper,
*  urx
