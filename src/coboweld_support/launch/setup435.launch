  Description:
    This file launches the UR5 with a Fronius Straight Torch as the end effector
    and an Intel Realsense D435 camera to capture point clouds.
    It can use MoveIt to plan and execute planning.
    
    When the argument with the name "sim" is set to true, it will use the
    ROS-Industrial simulator to drive the robot image in RViz to move but
    NOT the real robot.

    When the argument with the name "sim" is set to false, and the argument
    named "robot_ip" is set to the ip address of the robot, it will use the
    real robot to execute the planned action.

  Revision 1: 1 February, 2023.

  Revision 2: 3 February, 2023.
    Added the argument to publish ordered point clouds when launch the
    Realsense D455 camera.

  Revision 3: 9 February, 2023.
    Changed the camera from D455 back to D435
